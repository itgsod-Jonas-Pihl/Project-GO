Project-GO
==========

#### Why are we developing Project GO?
We believe that if gamers are able to easily group up with one another and play their favourite games. With complete strangers we can achieve a stronger and better community for PC gaming. This is where the idea of Project GO orginated

#### How are we going to achieve our goal?
We think that by using an already well known platform such as Steam and integrate it with an easy to use and easy to understand interface that everyone can access we will create a powerful tool for people to connect with each other through gaming.

#### What is Project GO?
Project GO is a website application idea that so far has 2 main uses. One is to find likeminded players to play games with. <br/>
The second use of the application is for pro players to offer professional lessons to other players that wants to improve, <br/>
The pro players decides the costs if any on the lessons and all of the players that wants to offer lessons needs to be certified <br/>
so that we can offer our users the safety and guarante that they get what the pay for
